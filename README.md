Diabetes prediction using machine learning (4 algorithms)

In this Project we will be predicting that whether the patient have diabetes or not basis on the features we will provide to our machine learning model and for that we will be using famous Diabetes Database - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaydattatraykhare/diabetes-dataset
Takeaways from this article
Data analysis : Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.
Exploratory data analysis : EDA is one of the most important step in data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis
Model building : Here we will be using 4 ML models and then we will choose the best performing model.
Saving model : Saving the best model using pickle to make the prediction from real data.
